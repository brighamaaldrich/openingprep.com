## Project Overview

The Chess Opening Analysis Application is a sophisticated web-based tool designed to analyze chess opening repertoires and identify performance patterns between two players. The application leverages machine learning to predict expected win/draw/loss rates based on positional features and player characteristics, enabling users to discover areas of over or under-performance in their opening play.

### Core Concept
The application creates "hypothetical games" by intersecting two players' opening repertoires - one player's white games and another's black games. This intersection reveals common lines that would likely occur if these players were to face each other, providing valuable insights for preparation and analysis.

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional chess analysis tools that rely solely on engine evaluation, this application uses a trained XGBoost model to predict expected results based on comprehensive positional and player features, creating a more nuanced understanding of performance beyond simple tactical evaluation.

## Product Description

### Target Users
- Chess players preparing for specific opponents
- Chess coaches analyzing student performance
- Chess analysts studying opening theory
- Tournament players seeking strategic insights

### Use Cases
1. **Opponent Preparation**: Analyze a specific opponent's repertoire to identify weaknesses and strengths
2. **Performance Analysis**: Compare actual results against expected results to identify areas for improvement
3. **Opening Theory**: Study how different players handle specific positions and variations
4. **Strategic Planning**: Understand the statistical likelihood of reaching certain positions against specific opponents

### Value Proposition
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Combines statistical analysis with machine learning predictions
- **Practical Application**: Focuses on realistic scenarios (intersected repertoires) rather than theoretical positions
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Provides expected vs. actual performance metrics
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Incorporates multiple factors beyond simple material evaluation

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

- **Frontend**: React.js SPA with Vite build system
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with Redis queue management
- **Background Processing**: Worker-based architecture for long-running analysis jobs
